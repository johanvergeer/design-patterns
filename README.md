# Design Patterns examples

Welcome to this repository with Design Patterns examples. These examples are written in Kotlin since this language is (
in my honest opinion) easy to understand for developers from most modern languages.

The samples are derived from samples I have found in several sources:

- [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/)
- [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/)

## How to use the samples?

The easiest way to use the samples is with
[IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate edition)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)

The start of each example is `Program.kt`. Most examples are in a single file because it turned out it is way easier to
understand an example from a single file than having to switch between multiple files. If you would like to see parts of
an example side by side you can right-click on the tab of a file and select `Split and move right` in IDEA based IDEs.

Some files contain `region`s, which allow you to collapse an entire block of code so that you can focus on what matters
most.

## How to contribute?

The point of this repository is to help other learn about Design Patterns. So any contribution, no matter how small, is
welcome.

1. Ask questions in the GitHub issues
2. Ask for clarification in the GitHub issues when a sample is not clear to you
3. Request extra samples in the GitHub issues
4. Add extra samples through a PR
